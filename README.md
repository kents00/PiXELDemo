“Converts your objects into pixel art”

## Introduction

Converting 3D meshes into pixel art is a popular technique that allows artists to create retro-style graphics with a modern 3D modeling tool. The process involves taking a 3D model and reducing the resolution adding pixelate node and so on to create a low-resolution, pixelated look. The results can then be used in a variety of applications, such as video games, animations, or digital art.
